# Purpose

When writing code, it's really _REALLY_ easy to put a `TODO` in your code as a
reminder to look at something later on. In small projects, you'll see those reminders
every time you open up the relevant files. In big projects with multiple contributors,
these can get unwieldly.

Without a proper strategy to work through them, your todos will only ever expand.
Toodaloo extracts these into a central file which can be tracked.
